Typical Errors
--------------
- ErrImagePull / ImagePullBackOff - The CI hasn't finished building the image yet or the image build has failed
  - Check whether the build is still in progress
    - If it is then increase "argocd_wait_for_sync_timeout"
    - If the build has failed then check the CI for the possible cause of the error
- Readiness / Liveness probe failed - The container is not fully functional yet
  - There could be many causes for this error, so there's no a single good solution for the problem
    - The best generic approach is to check the ArgoCD App for the underlying problems using the link above
      - Click on the problematic component and investigate "EVENTS" and "LOGS" tabs for clues
    - It could also be simply happening because, although everything seems to be correct, the app is not fully functional yet
      - In this case simply increase "argocd_wait_for_sync_timeout" value
