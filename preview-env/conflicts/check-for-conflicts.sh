#!/bin/bash

# This script checks the current repository for merge conflicts on open PRs labeled with `deploy-preview`
# A sticky comment will be upserted on all conflicted PRs.
# The script can also be called with `PR_ID` set to a single id to limit the scope.
# If `PR_ID` is set, there will be no check for the `deploy-preview` label to allow more freedom in usage.
# `GH_REPO` must be set like `<orga>/<repo>`.
# `LABEL_FILTERS` is an optional comma-separated list of labels to filter for and defaults to "deploy-preview".
# `COMMENT_BODY_TEMPLATE_PATH` is required, since paths will be determined during runtime.
#   When script's being called via Github Action, please set to `${{ github.action_path }}/templates/comment-body.md`
# All comments matching the `COMMENT_TAG` on non-conflicting PRs will be idempotently removed.
#
# Local Testing (Example Call):
# gh auth login # receive github token for authentication.
# GH_REPO=camunda/infra-global-github-actions COMMENT_BODY_TEMPLATE_PATH=templates/comment-body.md ./check-for-conflicts.sh
