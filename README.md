# Global Github Actions

This repository contains publicly visible Github Actions (GHA) maintained by the Infra team. Those actions are intended to be consumed by other teams inside Camunda.

Note: Until https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/74 is resolved, we need to use a public repository for this use case although an internal repository would be more fitting given the purpose.
