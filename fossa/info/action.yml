description: Provides context info required for other FOSSA composite actions.

inputs:
  github-token:
    description: |
      The GitHub token to use for API calls.
    default: ${{ github.token }}

outputs:
  is-pull-request:
    description: |
      True in the context of a pull request, false otherwise.
    value: ${{ steps.info.outputs.is-pull-request }}
  base-ref:
    description: |
      The ref (name) of the base branch in the context of a pull request.
      Empty if not a pull request.
    value: ${{ steps.info.outputs.base-ref }}
  base-revision:
    description: |
      The revision (commit SHA) of the base branch in the context of a pull request.
      Empty if not a pull request.
      Generally used to find (via diff) new license issues introduced by a PR.
    value: ${{ steps.info.outputs.base-revision }}
  base-revision-most-recent-with-scanning-results:
    description: |
      The latest base branch revision (commit SHA) with FOSSA scanning results.
      Useful when the base revision has no scanning results, such as after a manual merge commit that did not trigger a workflow (and so a scan).
      Empty if none found.
    value: ${{ steps.info-pr.outputs.base-ref-with-scanning-results }}
  head-ref:
    description: |
      The HEAD ref (name) of the branch to be analyzed by FOSSA, determined based on the context of the event.
    value: ${{ steps.info.outputs.head-ref }}
  head-revision:
    description: |
      The HEAD revision (commit sha) to be analyzed by FOSSA, determined based on the context of the event.
    value: ${{ steps.info.outputs.head-revision }}
