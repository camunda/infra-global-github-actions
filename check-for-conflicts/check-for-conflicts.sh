# This script checks the current repository for merge conflicts on open PRs labeled with `deploy-preview`
# A sticky comment will be upserted on all conflicted PRs.
# The script can also be called with `PR_ID` set to a single id to limit the scope.
# If `PR_ID` is set, there will be no check for the `deploy-preview` label to allow more freedom in usage.
# All comments matching the `COMMENT_TAG` on non-conflicting PRs will be idempotently removed.
